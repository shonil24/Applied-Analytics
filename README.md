### A2 

Admitted patients are patients who undergo a public or private  hospitalâ€™s formal admission process to receive treatment and/or care. The details of the admitted patients are recorded which include their No of overnight stays, Type of the hospital, Name of the hospital, etc.
The goal is to understand if there is any statistical significant difference in the average length of stay(days) between large and medium hospitals which might make patients choose one over the other
